👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Lira, from Santiago, Chile. (You can call me Lyra if you wish).

I’m interested in learning everything that can be used to solve tasks and problems. ✨
  (since I started I've never stopped learning... and so it goes on)
I'm a former web developer, and I'm also a nurse (RN), so I have a depth experience with teamwork and communication skills due to my previous background.

I'm a Web Developer and Data Analyst. I'm constantly learning new technologies to solve problems or creating interesting stuff.

Technologies:
- Ruby on Rails (love how fast it is)
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- JQuery (i know it's old and I prefer JS, but well...)
- R for Data Analysis and Data Visualization
- C

Currently learning:
- Javascript Full-Stack
- React
- Java/Spring

Some hobbies:
- Playing violin and guitar 🎶
- Aikido 🥋
- Coding 💻  ... also learning complex maths (ie: Calculus), it unlocks your brain 🤯
- Reading 📚
- Writing (reading a lot is how you learn how to write)
- Exercising/Calisthenics 🏃‍♂️ (achieved bar pull-over recently! 😊)

- and of course I love videogames 😎, here's what I've played during all my life: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VawjDan0tUKVKCTW6AdDB-g3vTMiiGETtHkg4y148Lk/edit?usp=sharing

Here's my current web Portfolio (made with RoR): https://portfolio-rails-2.onrender.com/  (Sheesh, I have to make a new one and updated. Stay tuned to see the future changes ;D)

I’m looking to collaborate on everything that fits my current capacities, and beyond :D  (everything has gone excellent in my way through IT Industry, I love it)

Lately I've been working as a freelance maintenance developer for some websites. Also, you can take a look to the pages in my repositories to make an idea about what i've learned during my first bootcamp. I can learn everything is there to learn, so I adapt myself to any job needed.
